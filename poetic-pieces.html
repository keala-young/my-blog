    <h3>Love Letters</h3>
    <p>Late September</p>

      <br>You appeared on a late afternoon</br>
      <br>With a bright smile and a helping hand.</br> 
      <br>Conversation poured like wine.</br> 
      <br>Your mere presence made me wonder,</br>
      <br>How long have I known you?</br>
      <br>It seems for hours or for years.</br> 
      <br>Time stands still.</br>
      <br>Yet, moments pass too quickly.</br>
      <br>Light fades to dark.</br>
      <br>And I eagerly await for you to appear once more,</br> 
      <p>...on a sunny afternoon.</p>
     
    <br><p>Early Winter</br></p>
      <br>Caught in between two worlds.</br>
      <br>I dont want to be with you</br> 
      <br>And I dont want to be without you.</br>
      <br>I yearn for your touch,</br>
      <br>Your warmth,</br>
      <br>Your praise and your gaze.</br>
      <br>Yet your hand feels cold</br>
      <br>And your lips, foreign.</br>
      <br>We got into my car and drove too fast too far.</br>
